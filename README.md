# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Element Behavior After Content Removal

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to HTML element display.  When a div's content is cleared and its display property is toggled (hidden, then shown), unexpected behavior may occur, especially when adding content again after clearing.

## Bug Description:

The primary issue is that after the innerHTML is set to empty and display style is toggled from block to none and back to block, it creates an unusual effect when adding new content back. This can manifest as inconsistencies in rendering, layout issues, or other unintended side effects. The exact behavior may vary depending on the browser and other aspects of the page. 

## How to Reproduce:

1. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
2. Click the button.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in the div's content and display.

## Solution:

The solution file (`solution.html`) demonstrates a simple method to avoid this issue by using a more straightforward and reliable approach to updating the element's content and visibility. Instead of using `innerHTML = ""`, consider using `textContent = ""` to clear the text node without triggering layout reflow and redraw that may cause the unexpected behavior. Alternatively, add or remove the div node from DOM tree if you don't need it anymore.
